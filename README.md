in the context of a study on accelerometers in Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, the above links contain the readme.txt and codebook documents to explain the study and the variables of the datasets.

The script run_analysi.R performs the five operations below in order to obtain the resulting tidy dataset described in step 5. 

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
